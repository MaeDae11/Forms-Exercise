DigitalCrafts: Introduction to Forms in HTML format


Forms Exercise project focuses on the use of forms within HTML. 
On top of that, I designed most of HTML in Bootstrap to get more practice with this language. 


Overall: 
This project was fun in reguards to the design (superhero theme) while altering the images and manipulating the background.
Within my HTML, I tried to rely mostly on Bootstrap. With that, I feel more confident in using Bootstrap syntax.
Forms in general were pretty easy. It's interesting how customizable they are for any need. 


Difficulties:
1. Using only Bootstrap to style this form. Offset was used quite a lot within this project. Learning to understand offset fully and how to manipulate it from screen size to screen size (xs - lg), while worring about the columns, was difficult.


Future: 
1. Adding even more form features while customizing the look of the boxes, checkboxes, etc.
